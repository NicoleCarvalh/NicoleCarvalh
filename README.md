### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicole, a software developer who's always excited to embark on coding adventures. Welcome to my GitHub playground!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my skills in JavaScript and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning and exploring new technologies to expand my toolkit.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to software development or my latest coding projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at nicolecarvalho6@gmail.com.
- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: I have a knack for collecting creepy and weird facts, ask me for one!
- ðŸŽ¶ When I'm not coding, you can find me strumming my ukulele, knitting cozy scarves, or showering love on my adorable pets.

Let's code, knit, and make some sweet melodies together! ðŸš€ðŸ§¶ðŸŽµ
